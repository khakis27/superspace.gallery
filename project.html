            Superstudio's utopian vision of the future was based on the square.
            They called the black and white grid, created from repeating the square, a “supersurface” 
            on which society could project new ways of building and living.
            Crafted with modular cubes, Superspace is a versatile and adaptable environment that easily transforms to accommodate various types of exhibitions,
            showcasing its fluid and adaptable design. the space is designed so that it can be used as a digital twin of real  exhibition spaces.
