                The curated selection of artists featured in this exhibition uniquely examines those intricate dynamics through their artistic expressions, employing artificial
                intelligence as a genuine tool for in-depth exploration. Each artist deliberately incorporates
                AI methodologies into their creative process, utilizing the technology as a tangible and
                thought-provoking means of investigating the contemporary nuances inherent in these complex societal constructs. By doing so, they not only <span class="highlight">shed light on the 
                biases</span>
                ingrained within AI systems but also actively contribute to a profound discourse on the current state of these dynamics. The artworks serve as compelling reflections on the intersection of humanity and technology, encouraging viewers to engage critically
                with the multifaceted implications and transformative potential of artificial intelligence in shaping our collective understanding of identity-related challenges.</br> <a href="/assets/catalogo.pdf" download>BROCHURE</a>
